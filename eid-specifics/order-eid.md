# Order e-ID certifiates for production

Before you are ready to accept production logins/signatures with real BankID, NemID etc. you must first obtain a certificate that identities your organisation to the end user signing in.

For each type of e-ID you must go through a separate process:

- **Danish NemID** is ordered directly by you from Nets and you will be invoiced directly by Nets based on your actual usage of NemID. [Read our short guide here](/eid-specifics/order-dk-nemid).
- **Norwegian BankID** is ordered and invoiced through Criipto. We are a registered reseller of Norwegian BankID. Please follow the steps described in [our guide](/eid-specifics/order-no-bankid)
- **Norwegian Vipps Login** is ordered by you directly directly from Vipps and invoiced through Criipto. We are a registered reseller of Norwegian Vipps Login. Please follow the steps described in [our guide](/eid-specifics/order-no-vipps)
- **Swedish BankID** is ordered through and invoiced through Criipto. We partner with Swedbank who must first approve your organization for BankID. Please fill out the Swedbank form as [described here](/eid-specifics/order-se-bankid/).
- **Finnish Trust Network**, BankID and mobile certificate (Mobiilivarmenne), simply requires you to fill out a simple *End Customer Agreement* with Telia Finalnd. Please follow the steps in [our guide](/eid-specifics/order-fi-bankid/).
- **Dutch DigiD** is ordered through Logius. We don't yet have our own description of this process, but please go to Logius' website to connect to the [DigiD service](https://logius.nl/diensten/digid/aansluiten-op-digid).
