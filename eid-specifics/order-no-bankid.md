# Ordering Norwegian BankID

To start accepting real users with Norwegian BankID, you must first request a set of secret keys - so-called _client credentials_ from the Norwegian BankID organisation.

### Prerequisites for ordering a BankID

In order to apply for the BankID secret keys for a company you must meet the basic requirements:

- Your company must be registered in the central Norwegian business registry, _Brønnøysundregistrene_
- Your company must be a customer of a Norwegian Bank. Most banks in Norway are part of the BankID network.
- The person that will sign the contract must be in possession of one of these personal e-IDs: Norwegian BankID, Swedish BankID, or Danish NemID

## Next steps

After Criipto has received the above information, we order the secret keys from your bank by filling out an online agreement. The agreement is then sent to the appointed person at your company for signing, after which also Criipto will sign. 

When all signatures are in place the signed agreement is sent to your bank for further processing and eventual issuance of your keys. 

Once you have received the secret keys, the client credentials, they must be entered into the Criipto Verify management UI to configure your NO BankID integration.
