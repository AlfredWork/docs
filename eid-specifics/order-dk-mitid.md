{% iconnote info %}

**MitID is expected to go live in mid August 2021**

The first person to be issued a MitID is planned for mid August 2021. All the holders of NemID will then be migrated
gradually to MitID during the following 6-9 months.

You can start ordering MitID for production from June 2021.  More on the process will be provided here.

### Prerequisites for setting up an agreement

In order to use MitID in production, your company must registered in the the EU and have an EU VAT Id.

### MitID terms of service

In addition to the genral [Criipto terms of service](https://criipto.com/legal/tos/) you must also accept the [MitID specific terms](https://criipto.com/legal/mitid/tos)

### UX requirements

With MitID you will be using a hosted MitID page at Criipto. The page may be styled to you liking, but some requirements must be
observed.

Please [see the UX reqirements](/eid-specifics/mitid-ux-reqs) to make sure you comply.

### Next steps

*More to follow shortly*.

# Order MitID for test

If you haven't already done so, you can apply for access to the MitID test environment from the `Identity Sources` tab in Criipto Verify's management UI - in the `DK MitID` section.

Once Criipto has received your application, we will onboard your company to the MitID test environment and get back to you. It may take a few days for us to process your application.

When done, you can return to the management UI and complete your MitID configuration, such as selecting which NemID domain you want to use for side-by-side mode with MitID during the transition phase.
