This tutorial demonstrates how to add user login to an ASP.NET Core 2.x application. We recommend you to Log in to follow this quickstart with examples configured for your account.

Four steps are required to complete your first test login:

2. [Configure callback URLs](#urls)
3. [Configure your application to use Criipto Verify](#application)
4. [Trigger authentication in your application](#trigger)
