## Use e-ID in your applications

For an introduction to Criipto Verify and e-ID, you may want to read [the overview](/getting-started/overview) in the Getting Started section.

Criipto Verify supports two distinct use cases supported by most e-ID solutions:

- **Authentication**. All e-ID services supports user authentication. With Criipto Verify you integrate using *OpenID Connect* (aka OIDC). For more on how to use OIDC with Criipto, please refer to the language and platform specific guides in the section on "Authentication Integration". Also a general introduction to OIDC with Criipto Verify is available in the section on [Using OIDC](/getting-started/oidc-intro).
- **Digital Signatures**. Due to the underlying use of assymetric encryption by some e-ID services, like the Norwegian and Swedish BankID, digitally signing text is also supported through a proprietary Criipto API. Documentation on this will soon follow.

Please use the navigation on the left to locate the content you need. Or if no documentation is found, please do not hesitate to drop us a note at [support@criipto.com](mailto:support@criipto.com).
