# Onboarding to MitID test
In contrast to most of the other e-ID methods we support, you must be explicitly onboarded to the MitID test environment before you can fully test your integration.

## Apply for test access
1. Go to the [management dashboard](https://manage.criipto.id) and set the environment toggle at the top center to "TEST".
2. In the `Identity Sources` tab, expand the `DK MitID` section
3. Enter the details for your company and click `Apply`
4. Await feedback from Criipto. We will have NETS set up DNS for your selected `.pp.mitid.dk` domain.

Expect this process to take 2-5 work days.
