# E-ID Test Users

Almost all e-ID types have a notion of _test_ and _real_ users.

_Real users_ are real people logging in to a web site, thus voluntering their real name and typically also a social security number, SSN.

_Test users_ are either created by you for the occasion, or we provide you with access to already created test users. 

You may refer to the sections below for test users for your choice of e-ID.

## Swedish BankID

Swedish BankID test users are created at the <a href="https://demo.bankid.com/" target="_blank">demo web site</a>.   

Even if the demo site is where you will actually create your test users, it does link to the <a href="https://www.bankid.com/bankid-i-dina-tjanster/rp-info" target="_blank">general BankID technical page</a>. As a Criipto Verify customer you don't have worry about most of what's this site, but on the page is also a link to the document describing in detail how to create and use test user accounts. The document is called something like "How to get a test BankID" and links to a PDF.

_Note_ that, as is also described in the document, using test BankID users does require a reconfiguration of the BankID application. This means it cannot be used for real BankID. So if you are Swedish and already have BankID on your phone, you may want to use a spare phone for testing.

## Norwegian BankID

Two types of Norwegian BankID are available:

1. _Web based BankID with a hardware token_. Also called _Netcentric_ accounts, test users from this type of BankID may be created and used on the fly
2. _Mobile BankID_. Norwegian mobile BankID is based on a socalled _SIM card application_ which means you need a special SIM card issued by one of the Norwegian carriers. 

### Creating netcentric test users

Test users are created through the web page at [https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser](https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser).

1. Go to the "TEST NUMBER GENERATOR" to generate a random, valid SSN
2. It now says "Could not find any bankIDs for ..."
3. Fill out the first name, last name, and BankID friendly name.
4. Click "Order" to initiate the process
5. Once the process complete you now have a test user. User name is the generated SSN, one time password (OTP) is always "otp", and password is always "qwer1234"

You can test it out at [www.grean.id](https://www.grean.id) which is a small sample run by Criipto. 

### Testing Mobile BankID 

For testing you may order up to three test SIM cards through Criipto once you have signed up for Norwegian BankID.
